To Do:

x * Improve error reporting for when provide incorrectly typed
   arguments when calling function.
 
x * Fix error that occurs when do not have any declared variables at
   top of each endpoint section.

x * Add other endpoint into type checking


 * Type check traces
 * Throw okay error if do not name endpoint at top endpoint section
   correctly (eg., name both the same thing).

 * Throw better error if endpoint is empty.
 
 * For incorrectly declared variables, maybe present some "you may
   have meant XXXXX" error message.

 * Test that do not write to any variable that do not control.
   
 * Determine syntax for generics Map and List; determine if want
   syntax for doing things by value
 * Eventually, may want to lex/parse for common errors.  For instance,
   if use "Equals" instead of "==", parse for "==" and report error.

 * Warn unused functions.  Error on unused functions?

 * Need to ensure that all msgReceive functions have same type
   signature.

 * Ensure that nothing makes a function call to a msgReceive function.
 
 * Need to better-define ReturnableExpression.  Right now, can only
   provide literals and function calls.
 * During semantic analysis, if have more than one argument in
   funcArgList, check that no arguments are empty.

Major to dos:
  1) Decide on how discovery should work
  2) Determine exact rules for trying to send a message (do you queue
     more than one message, etc.)
  3) Specifying error conditions/what happens on error/after some time
  4) What is structure of message?  Can we type check it?
  5) How does time play into when respond?  Do we have a notion of
     time/timers?  What is it?
  5) Come up with overall experiment
  6) Come up with ideal micro-evaluations
     -Turk for names "Bool" vs "TrueFalse"; "String" vs "Text".
  7) Decide which target to generate code for (likely python).
  8) Decide on interface between target code and existin code
     -What visualizations allow programmer to see how things work?
  9) Decide on visualizations to present error messages and do some
     work on what error messages should look like.
   
   
Notes:
  Ors and Ands have same precedence and are left-associative.



  
Questions:

Should decide whether should have basic initializers for variables or
allow for more complex statements (returnable expressions).

Annotation for shared data seems off.  Right now, just have one
general CONTROLS annotation.  Can have more nuanced rules, where a
piece of state can only be modified directly in a message response
chain instead of at the outset of response.  Similarly, may want to
make state only writable.  We'll see.

Should ElseIf use camel-case or underscore?  Mechanical Turk it.


Ideas:

Are there any benefits behind reporting syntax errors sequentially,
instead of reporting many at once?  That would be conventional wisdome
to overturn.

Syntax error reporting is hard.  This is because when hit a syntax
error, yacc does not actually report to you which state it can't get
out of (or the deepest state that it can get into before failing).
This is a problem because can't report targetted syntax errors without
parsing for them specifically.  If provide this extra bit of
information, maybe can provide more informative syntax error: "looks
like you may have forgotten a semi-colon", "don't forget a comma
here", etc.  Note that this may fit in with SOSP paper about
configuration error messages.


Dual Process Theory may define what it means to be a novice language
and a non-novice language.  No one else has suggested why an expert
would no longer use a novice language.  Dual Process Theory may be a
tool to identify and explain the fundamental tradeoffs in language design.

Identifies a fundamental language tradeoff between expressiveness
and readability.  Probably a natural metaphor with command line versus
gui.  

According to a lot of our theory, we should be able to re-design
Haskell to have a much lower learning curve by changing around a lot
of its syntax.  Maybe think about doing that as evaluation for paper.

Special language for configuration files.  Maybe throw error when
overwrite variable's existing value.  Maybe throw warnings when
variables are named very closely to one another.


Should == be "IsEqualTo" and != be "IsNotEqualTo"?  This really,
really depends on our target.  It's a fundamental tradeoff.  

I really think that the function declaration syntax needs more work.
It should reflect, these things come in, those things go out.

Something of a Public <FunctionName> : In { };
                                       Out{ };
                                       WhatToDo
                                       {

                                       }
Of course, keep in mind it depends if we're targetting novices or not.  


Require parens for grouping on == and !=. 
Require parens for grouping on or and and?
Maybe make multiplicatino be with x?

 
Long-term to do:
 

Incorporate errors into Trace syntax.  Probably put errors at end of
each trace line.  (Ie, for each trace line, no matter where the error
occurs in the trace line, all error handling on each side happens in
one function.)  Use prose keyword, such as "OnError" to deal with
each.  Maybe also provide ability to specify how long to wait until a
message times out.

Presumably, only one trace line can execute at a time.  What is model
for queueing other message lines?
