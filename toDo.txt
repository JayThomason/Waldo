To Do:

x * Graphically print asts
x * Separate ast building code from overall parsing code.  want to put
   a nice frontend on parsing.
x * Textually print asts
x * Pass line numbers through for ast building errors and into ast
   nodes.
x * Add some notation for trace message functions.     
 * Add productions to ast builder.
