To Do:

x * Graphically print asts
x * Separate ast building code from overall parsing code.  want to put
   a nice frontend on parsing.
x * Textually print asts
x * Pass line numbers through for ast building errors and into ast
   nodes.
x * Add some notation for trace message functions.     
 * Add productions to ast builder.
 * Create test infrastructure for asts


 
Incorporate errors into Trace syntax.  Probably put errors at end of
each trace line.  (Ie, for each trace line, no matter where the error
occurs in the trace line, all error handling on each side happens in
one function.)  Use prose keyword, such as "OnError" to deal with
each.  Maybe also provide ability to specify how long to wait until a
message times out.

Presumably, only one trace line can execute at a time.  What is model
for queueing other message lines?
