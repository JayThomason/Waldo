To Do:

 * Graphically print asts
 * Separate ast building code from overall parsing code.  want to put
   a nice frontend on parsing.
 * Textually print asts
 * Pass line numbers through for ast building errors and into ast
   nodes.
 * Add productions to ast builder.
 * Add some notation for trace message functions.  
 * Create test infrastructure for asts
