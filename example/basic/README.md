Basic
========================

More for demonstrative purposes than practicality.  Simple example
that creates a TCP connection between two endpoints.  A Requester
endpoint can request the Incrementer endpoint to add a number to an
argument and return it.

Demonstrates:
  * Initiating sequences through function calls
  * Passing arguments into sequences
  * Returning data from sequences
  * Using Waldo libraries to listen for TCP connections and spin off
    an endpoint object
  * Using Waldo libraries to create TCP connection
  * Using endpoint global data
