Permit commas in numbers.  There's an old paper on novices learning
PASCAL (I think?) that says this could be a big deal.

Maybe have types for different types of time.  1s versus 1 minute,
etc.  Addition and subtraction operators would be defined on them
easily.



Error Reporting:

The error message should contain a link to the section of the
rules that the statement violates.  (high-level) to assess: whether
that reduces the frequency of bugs faster.


Have waldo scripts compiled by a server, make waldo scripts a
service.  This way, can see how it's being used, common bugs, and
evolve error messages, and feedback.

Compiler error messages are doing interesting things, such as
reporting function text/listing as part of error message, when have a
collision, shows where collision is, etc.  These are independently
interesting questions.
